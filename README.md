- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skeeter-Valentine aka Brenden
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (obviously), snowboarding, disc golf, playing guitar, and listening to live music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about coding! I started out as a self taught react.js developer and am now working as an angular.js intern.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool project that you might need help with! I'm looking for experience and diverse work, so if you've got something you think I could help you with let me know!
- 📫 You can reach me at brendencyr24@gmail.com Feel free to reach out!
